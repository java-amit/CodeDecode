The Strategy design pattern is particularly useful in situations like
 sorting data with different algorithms,
  processing payments with various methods,
   or handling notifications through diverse channels
    (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
    
The Strategy design pattern is used where a particular task can be 
performed in multiple ways, and the specific method needs 
to be chosen dynamically at runtime.
